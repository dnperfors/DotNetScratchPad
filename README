This is my personal scratchpad project for learning different kind of techniques.
My first project is a custom implementation for Linq to Objects (or the Enumerable class).
My goal is to use this project to learn more about Test Driven Development and the
techniques I work with.

Future projects could be:
- a custom Linq 2 SQL provider
- a mocking framework
- some test utilities
- some usefull extension methods
