This Enumerable implementation is largely based on EduLinq from John Skeeter.

The Tests are mostly taken from John Skeeter, but most of the actual implementation
I wrote myself. Based on the code I found in the blogposts of John, the actual .NET
code and the Mono code, I refactored the implementation to what it is now.
